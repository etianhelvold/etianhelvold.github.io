Angular personal portfolio app

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 15.1.6.

## Purpose
This page is made to showcase in the future the projects I've worked on which are not subject to any NDA or anything of the sort.
I'll make an attempt at making it so it showcases my abilities in Angular although I can't stress enough I'm not a designer. :P

## Future Plans
I'll also try to use the github api to retrieve my projects instead of hardcoding them into the page, using the readme as a description the repo name as a title and somehow add a thumbnail if desired.
In the future I intend to add a backend, investigate where and how to host it, the API will most likely be NodeJS or Spring.
As far as DB go I intend to have a showcase of both Document Oriented DB (MongoDB most likely) and SQL (PostgreSQL most likely). I just haven't figured out a decent use for them.
